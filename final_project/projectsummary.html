        <h1>Andy Li | Project Summary</h1>
        <p>
            The topic of this final project is to create a personal website for myself. I wanted to create something that I could attach to
            my applications as a means of showcasing my ability in web development. Furthermore, if I ever were to create more projects and
            have more experiences, I want to be able to highlight them in this website. The purpose was to create a website (almost like a 
            portfolio) that can be used in professional and casual settings. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The extras I used in this website are a form (in the contact section) as well as transitions and transformations. The "Contact Me"
            section of my website was constructed on the basis of a form. It allows the user to submit their name, email, and a message as if
            they were going to contact me. For now, it sends them to a confirmation html that tells them that their message has been received.
            For the transformations and transitions, I used them for small design elements of my website. For the navigation, when you hover
            over my header titles (like Home, About, Life, Contact), it will slowly create this purple underline on the title you are
            hovering over. It also happens in the "About" section for the subtabs (like Skills, Experience, Education, and Resume). However, those
            only use transitions to edit how slowly the line creates. I used transformation only in one tiny section of the website: the social
            media icons in the Contact section. When you hover over each icon, they move up by a few pixels. I use the transformY function to do so
            and used transition to also edit how slowly it moves up. It creates this cool animation effect as if it was hovering on the page.
