        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

        <div>
            Topic:
            The website will serve as a home page for my dance team, Chaotic 3. The goal will be to show different
            aspects about the organization, from workshops we do in school as well as the competitions we perform at.
        </div>

            Audience:
            The intended audience is anyone who knows Chaotic 3, anyone who is interested in joining the team, and the
            members on the team. 
        </div>

            Design and Style: 
            The design and style will follow a clean and shape-oriented design. The goal is to keep everything very legible
            with the usage of a lot of rectangular and square shapes.

        <div>
            Scope: 
            The website will be a one-page website with multiple sections. The sections will include an About/Summary Section,
            a Meet the Team section (mainly introducing the current e-board members), a Timeline/History section that includes
            photos and videos from previous years, and a Contact Us section for people to reach out to C3. There will also be a header
            that will direct the user to these distinct sections. There will also be a footer that has social media symbols for users 
            to easily navigate to C3's social media.
