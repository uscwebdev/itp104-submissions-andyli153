            With a strong commitment for excellence, a nature of spontaneity and freeness, and the endless aspiration to learn, I look forward to always put my best work forward and continuously grow. 
            Evident from my previous experiences, I am not afraid to dive into different and unique areas of study, whether it be accounting, marketing, or consulting. 
            I am in the midst of searching for an opportunity that can bring help and joy to the people around me as well as pushing the world to be a better place. Discovering the intersection between business and life is what makes the work valuable and fulfilling.
